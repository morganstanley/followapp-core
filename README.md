FollowApp is an analytics backed, cloud-based technology solution to remind and follow up with underprivileged mothers living in slums for their children's critical immunizations. FollowApp not only disseminates information to create awareness but also gathers critical data such as the vaccination status of the children for all diseases. FollowApp today has 4000+ benefactors, caters to 3 different does and 7 different vaccines, and we are now looking to expand to other healthcare areas as well. 

followapp-core contains the core batch job to make automated IVR calls, the core APIs to interact with the IVR service and the database DDL scripts.

Please note that you would need to provide the configurations of the API key, and other parameters to run the app. Detailed setup steps coming soon.
